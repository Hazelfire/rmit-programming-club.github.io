Hey everyone!

I'm Sam Nolan, first year computer science student and known to know a lot of
"classics in the field". I'll just go through a few of my favourite programming
related books for you bookworms to put your nose through.

## Code quality
### Code Complete 2
If there ever was an introduction to code quality, it's Code Complete 2. Completely
non political or controversial. Other than the fact that it states that this style:

```
if() {

}
```

is in all ways superior to this style

```
if() 
{

}
```

Which is obviously true. But other than that, it's a good resource for beginners
in any programming language to familiarise themselves with what makes good
code and why. Very approachable.

### Clean Code
This is what you read after Code Complete, the next level of code quality. Written
by Robert C Martin, this one is a tad more political than the above, but contains
some invaluable insights with how to make code more understandable. All it's
examples are also in Java.

If you can implement all the ideas in this book, you are well on your way to
becoming a programming that won't get shot by your other developing companions.

### Refactoring
A classic in the field, this book is a reference manual with different ways
that you can incrementally improve the structure of your code in order to make
it more understandable. More technical than Clean Code, doesn't lead with many
valuable insights as much as a methodology that you should follow when writing
quality code. But still worth the read, even if you skip most of the catalogue
part as 99% of it is done in IDEs for you.

### Design Patterns, (gang of four)
Another classic in the field. This book is a catalogue of different "patterns"
or structures of code that achieve different purposes. If you get in the habit
of using patterns, you are starting to become a software architect, which helps
you design systems that are tolerant to change and maintainable.

I would recommend reading both Code complete and Clean code before this one.
Most of the book is a catalogue and can be used as a reference, but it's worth
taking a skim through all the different creatures that you get to see or code
in software development.

## System's thinking
Systems thinking is **REALLY COOL AND YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT IMMEDIATELY**. 
Although the stuff that you find on the internet isn't that interesting (or correct
to systems engineering), reading some of these books can get your feet in the water.

System's thinking is treating management as a science, and simulating management
situations using feedback loops. For instance, the human body is a system. What
makes it a system is that all it's physically change over time (cells die and
create new cells), however, you stay being you. How cool is that! That comes
from the bodies ability to stabilise itself by feedback loops, if the body
requires energy, you get hungry etc. This type of model can be used to model
so many really cool things! And it is worth checking it out.

### System's thinking - A primer
This book is written by a student of Jay Wright Forester, who pioneered systems
thinking. It's a small introduction that is almost impossible to get your hands
on but nevertheless is worth it.

What interesting is that the author, Donella Meadows, is able to argue about terms
that seem to most to be rather heuristic, such as environment conservation,
holistic healthcare and genetically modified animals, in terms of engineering
style systems. Which makes for very logical arguments to why things work the
way they do that I've never seen before. Worth a read.

### Industrial Dynamics
Written by the man himself, Jay Wright Forster, this book kicked off System's
thinking back in 1961. However, it's almost impossible to get your hands on,
the only copy that the RMIT library holds I have borrowed ;). It contains a more
empirical and mathematical description of how to apply system's thinking to different
problems. Definitely worth a read, but make sure you read the primer above first
so I have enough time to get through it.

### Godel, Escher, Bach an eternal golden braid
This book wins a prize for the only non fiction book I literally could not put
down. Although it's not necessarily system's thinking, I'm putting it here
because I believe that it actually forms a mathematical basis for what system's
thinking takes for granted. This is definitely, a "classic in the field"

This book is a rollercoaster through art, music, artificial intelligence, literature,
language, biology and most importantly, logic and philosophy. The book is 
quite large but does not waste a single word. Very highly recommended particularly
for mathematics and logic geeks. Gives a complete explanation of Godel's incompleteness
theorem as well as it's implications. Fantastic read.

What's funny is that the book has a prologue that explains that many people
were always confused of what the book was actually about. If your curious, it's
about artificial intelligence. I only worked that out in the last few chapters.

## The future
Books that predict that try to predict the future are very interesting to read.
They often however wildly differ from each other, so they should be taken with
a grain of salt. I'll go through a few books that make predictions about the future
and their different viewpoints.

### Homo Deus
This book is very easy to find, basically any modern bookstore will have it.
It takes the assumption that humans will continue to try and make themselves
happy and follow down the path of artificial intelligence and therefore speed
up evolution through technology that will create immortal and super intelligent
humans.

This book is pretty thick however, and off the top of my head goes on
for a very long time on why Christianity in necessarily false. The book makes
predictions on what will happen if nothing overly interesting occurs in the future,
and we just get better at what we already do. As of such, probably should be
taken with a grain of salt, as something unexpected is likely to happen.

### Debt, the first 5000 years
Only read this if you are a very into books, this book is a reference to the history
of money and all it's uses since it's inception, and as of such, is a LOT of history.

What's good about history, as he points out, is that once you understand history
you can be liberated from it. You understand where the modern culture comes from and
think differently instead. This book tries to destroy the myth that barter ever
existed and also shows that the entire concept of money, economies, trade and
loans are not necessarily natural parts of
a system. In particular, he makes the argument that money only comes into play
when it is paired with a significant amount of violence.

Worth a read as it allows you to think about how society would look under different
rules, even if you just read the bit at the end about today's day and age
and therefore what's likely to happen. The author instead takes an approach
to looking into the future by seeing how the past has operated, and observing
the cycles.

### Life after Google
George Gilder (the author) is looking at a more short term future based of the projects
that exist in regards to the blockchain. The author wrote a book
called "Life after television" which foreshadowed mobile phones, and apparently
Steve Jobs read and distributed to his fellow Co-workers, and look where we are
now! So George has some pretty good credentials for looking into the future!
Although, I believe he talks about Godel's incompleteness theorem's in a bit
of a naive way and doesn't believe artificial intelligence will surpass
human intelligence. Nevertheless, worth a read based off the blockchain knowledge
he has collected.
